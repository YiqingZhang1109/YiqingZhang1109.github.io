                        <p class="second">
                            We thought that we had become aboriginals in the Internet age. We 
                            thought that videos, live broadcasts, push notifications with pictures 
                            and texts, and a massive database that could be viewed at any time were 
                            enough to satisfy our thirst for knowledge and learning until the arrival 
                            of the new crown epidemic in 2020.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an instant, we really became people in the cave. Meeting has 
                            become a distant future. When Socrates' Q&A can only be done through 
                            the network cable, the talks of the Jixia Academy must use the 
                            Tencent meeting. We adjusted the screen brightness and headset sound 
                            to the maximum, but we still couldn't really open the window in 
                            front of us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is also a difficult year for Project Nous Changsha Camp. In fact, as early as December, the Project Nous Organizing Committee planned to return to Changsha during the summer vacation to continue the flames of last year. Despite the twists and turns during the period, after the anti-epidemic situation became clear, we decided to return to Changsha in the summer to hold the Project Nous reading camp offline. Although we have also seen other organizations of the same type move online, the Project Nous has always pursued not only knowledge, but discussions and collisions with temperature and sparks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, since the establishment of the Changsha Camp Organizing Committee in March, we have been engaged in intense work. In order to ensure the quality of the course, we interviewed nearly a hundred outstanding applicants with other organizing committees of Project Nous, and conducted a total of ten hours of training for each admitted applicant. At the same time, the organizing committee of the Changsha Camp also called each other countless times in the middle of the night to discuss enrollment or sponsorship strategies and preparations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it is not someone else who has devoted the most effort and effort to this year's Changsha Camp. It is our team of readers. They gave up the comfortable two-week vacation and traveled all over the country to Changsha, selflessly bringing ten days of excellent courses to the participants of the Changsha camp. They take their courses seriously, and we admire them. From the moment the readers were admitted, they started designing courses, revising handouts, and conducting trial lectures, although at that time, some readers did not even know whether they could break through the barriers of global change and go to Changsha for appointments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in the end, we were lucky to meet offline.

                            The site of the Project Nous was chosen at Meixi Lake, which was provided by Wen Yun Ai Reading. With both lakes and mountains, soft morning sun and cool evening breeze, it is the most beautiful piece of land in Changsha. The fly in the ointment is that it is far from the center of the city, and students need to travel through a long time to get there. But despite this, at eight o'clock in the morning of the opening ceremony, there was already a long line before the sign-in place.

                        <p>
                            Ten classrooms, five in the morning and five in the afternoon, date back to the Axis Era of ancient Greece, and predict the changes in the Middle East in the past. Thucydides and Du Fu are separated by a wall, and German idealism and neuroscience meet each other. These seminars not only lead the people's passionate explanations, but also provide a space for students to express their opinions.

                            According to the readersâ€™ own lesson plan and pace, a period of rest will be arranged during the course. The inconsistent time between classes also gives everyone the opportunity to enter other classrooms or just sit at the door and listen. Perhaps you can also take this opportunity to have a more in-depth exchange with the reader. In Project Nous, the doors and windows of each classroom will not become the boundary of knowledge.

                        <p>
                            During the lunch break, with the mouth-watering aroma of meals, the readers screened programs such as "Summer of the Band" and "Black Mirror" in their classrooms. This is a unique luncheon. In the lounge of the organizing committee, there are also readers who will improvisely draw a map of the world and start pointing the situation.

                        <p>
                            Between five and six in the afternoon, different activities are arranged every day: debates between readers and students, lectures by special guests, and salon discussions on the significance of liberal arts education... For ten days, we are concerned about the epidemic. China focuses on the advancement and retreat of liberal arts education. We don't demand the perfection of the viewpoint. What we want to hear is the voice that belongs to everyone after thinking.

                        <p>
                            In the twilight, the readers returned to the homestay where they lived together. Project Nous has always insisted on letting readers have a space for living and discussing together. With different educational backgrounds and life experiences, every reader is a library, with legendary stories that others cannot imagine. Meixi Lake went to sleep late at night, but the collision and blending between the interesting souls continued...

                            Growing up in the north, I never thought I could be so happy in the summer in Changsha. The epidemics in spring and winter have trapped me in my monotonous life. Although the summer is late, it has proven time and time again that this is still an era in which mankind needs mankind. Happiness and trust have become simple, it's just taking out together, laughing together, reading together, breaking thoughts together, and lighting a small ideal torch together in the fog of the future.

                        <p>
                            The summer of Project Nous is quite meaningful to me. Because I have been studying abroad for a long time, and most of my contacts are humanities and social science researchers, I haven't stepped out of the ivory tower to understand the current issues for a long time. Participating in these ten-day seminars forced me to turn my understanding of theory into life, put aside the stacking of classics and documents, and seriously think about how political theory can be warmer in real life and how it can be more meaningful to ordinary people's lives. This is also a concern that I will continue to work hard to retain in my future studies and research. On the other hand, because of the Project Nous, I have met many young people at home and abroad who are interested in liberal arts education. Their different education and life experiences have further prompted me to reflect on education-how can I serve more people The balance between providing high-quality educational resources to promote social justice and emphasizing the non-utilitarian nature of liberal arts education to preserve the tranquility of reading classic texts may be a contradiction that liberal arts education in the future society needs to continue to face.

                            We seem to have been discussing what is Project Nous and what is liberal arts education, but in fact, I think you are the best example. You let me read books I have never read before, start thinking about problems I have never thought about before, and take me to a wider world, making me want to be a better person. You are doing a very bright thing, and you will finally get rid of the clouds and see the light.

                        <p>
                            In my opinion, Project Nous is an ivory tower without utilitarianism and copper smell. Here I meet a group of selfless and outstanding brothers and sisters, and get to know a group of like-minded peers... Once I was used to accepting standard answers, but the elegant discussion class inspired me a little bit of the most original creativity, expressing the true My own opinion. We put aside all worries, communicate without restraint, break the inertia of thinking, and even question the paradigm that we take for granted. Not only is the angle of thinking about life broadened, but the ten-day study has also subtly prompted me to further explore my worldview and seek true knowledge. Fortunately, Project Nous! Unforgettable seventy hours of our thinking collision.                        </p>
