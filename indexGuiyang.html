                            The time of midsummer is always short and beautiful. Even now it’s late autumn, the memories of August seem to have not faded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even if it took a long time to slowly write the story of Project Nous Guiyang Camp, when I closed my eyes, the laughter and the sound of my fingers slowly turning the pages of the book were still very clear in my mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The stall selling millet porridge downstairs in the camp, the Xiaoya home-cooked food in Hongtong City that is never enough to eat, the number one line of not many people; the fierce debate, the rumbling sound of the air-conditioning on the head when reading books, the first bulge The satisfaction of courage to speak; lesson preparation in the homestay, routine feedback after the end of the reading camp every day, the provincial museum on the weekend and the green tea for takeaway...                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These time fragments are probably the bits and pieces that came to my mind when I mentioned the Project Nous Guiyang Camp.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Project Nous has never expected a top-down, traditional learning experience; on the contrary, we hope to build an open reading community in the local area so that non-local readers can interact with the local The high school and college students communicate with each other to establish a diverse and inclusive circle. We hope that the seniors and sisters of these readers can share what they know, learn and want to the local students, and study together.

                        <p>
                            In China, the concept of "reading club" is not mature, especially in second-tier cities like Guiyang. Therefore, when we try to introduce a new concept to the local area, we will inevitably encounter some doubts and distrust. However, just like the speeches of many students at the closing ceremony, the experience that Project Nous brings to the young group is difficult to describe in a quantitative perspective, but the impact it brings is real exist.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, we can say that we have read a lot of shining works in areas rarely involved in our daily lives, such as Hemingway’s works, ancient Greek myths, essays by famous teachers in international relations, Arendt’s political thoughts, Durkheim’s Articles, existential philosophy; we can also say that we have learned a lot of interesting experiments in the history of Homo sapiens cognitive development, thought-provoking discoveries in pedagogy, difficult paintings in art history, and various concepts in anthropology . We can say that we have learned a certain knowledge, a certain theory, and a certain discovery. However, such a project of Project Nous brings more to the participants.

                        <p>
                            Knowledge will always be slowly forgotten from our minds, especially in a reading camp where there is no pressure to enter a higher education, no evaluation criteria, and even the so-called "final assessment". We don’t expect rote memorization, just short Ten days can only be an introduction to a certain subject. However, it is in these ten days of uninterrupted thinking collision that we can obtain a new way of thinking. This way of thinking is not dualistic, there is no absolute right or wrong, only relative completeness and incompleteness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the book club, the reader will raise a question, and the students in a circle will start a discussion with you and me. Her speech mentioned a very good point, and another student explained it. His speech took the discussion to a new height, and the readers would then put forward their opinions...After a round of discussion, what was created was the continuous divergence of thinking and a new level of understanding of the text. . More importantly, such a so-called insight is not printed on paper, only white and black characters that need passive memory. As Socrates said, reading is a passive learning experience, but the collision of discussions is an active experience. The more you give to it, the more you gain.

                            The summer of Project Nous is quite meaningful to me. Because I have been studying abroad for a long time, and most of my contacts are humanities and social science researchers, I haven't stepped out of the ivory tower to understand the current issues for a long time. Participating in these ten-day seminars forced me to turn my understanding of theory into life, put aside the stacking of classics and documents, and seriously think about how political theory can be warmer in real life and how it can be more meaningful to ordinary people's lives. This is also a concern that I will continue to work hard to retain in my future studies and research. On the other hand, because of the Project Nous, I have met many young people at home and abroad who are interested in liberal arts education. Their different education and life experiences have further prompted me to reflect on education-how can I serve more people The balance between providing high-quality educational resources to promote social justice and emphasizing the non-utilitarian nature of liberal arts education to preserve the tranquility of reading classic texts may be a contradiction that liberal arts education in the future society needs to continue to face.                    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Project Nous Guiyang Camp, we are committed to creating such an experience. As college students and graduate students, our readers are very familiar with this kind of learning experience. Of course, as students themselves, the seminars they lead must have many imperfections. But I also believe that it is precisely because of their student status that the discussion of the Project Nous has no sense of distance.

                            "I have gained a lot from Project Nous, and I don't know if it is good or bad. I remember that I didn't have so many "outrageous", "did you know", "right" before. I don't know if it is permissible to take out green tea restaurants every day The chalk dust deposited in the lungs may also be an irreversible health hazard. But I can be sure that this August is the highlight of 2020.

                            The clearest memory is that I just finished the introduction to logic in the first class. I looked at the dense logic symbols written on the blackboard with zero readability. Then I saw the blank faces of the students, and I suddenly became nervous. At that time, I discovered what the Battalion Commander Weiyi said "Project Nous is not a playhouse". As a reader, I am responsible for every student's understanding of difficult concepts in books. Reading is not easy; but seeing the students gradually improve, from the slightly awkward self-introduction in the first class to the unique insights into Kant’s original work, I realized that the sense of accomplishment and responsibility of a reader is directly proportional of.

                        <p>
                            Of course, the identity of the reader brings not only a sense of accomplishment and responsibility, but also the company of the other 9 readers and the opportunity to giggle together. Whether it’s a meeting until 11 o’clock or a hurried breakfast on the steps of a subway station, I feel that the sparks I made with this group of obsessive and persistent peers who are obsessed with truth may not be annihilated in this life.

                            "I dare say that participating in the Project Nous is the most correct decision I have ever made in 2020. No matter how the wheel of time rolls forward, that period of time will always shine in my memory. I have met many interesting and thoughtful people, We communicate with souls; I think outside the system and see a different world; I have come into contact with many disciplines, which makes me more eager to understand and change the world. The things I have learned in these ten days are really better than I have learned in recent years, I will always love the Project Nous, always love those people, and always love the world. Once again, I will still participate."

                            Of course, the Project Nous is far from perfect. Our organizing committee is a group of college students like me. While we are being dignified, we are also experiencing growth and pain. 2020 is also a new year for Project Nous. Although we are very happy that Project Nous Guiyang Camp has successfully landed and started, we are also very clear that the Project Nous has a long time to go.

Finally, thank you to all the participants who came to Project Nous Guiyang Camp this summer. It was you who lit up this idealistic glimmer, and I believe that one day, the glimmer will converge into a torch.
