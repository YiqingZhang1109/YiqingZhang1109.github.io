                        Project Nous was founded in 2016. It is a non-profit education project 
                        organized by a group of Chinese college students from all over the world. 
                        It aims to bring small class seminars and reading experience to high school 
                        students in non-first-tier cities and counties. Since its establishment, we 
                        have recruited a group of excellent readers every summer and winter, and 
                        help them form a habit of dialectical thinking and establish a connection 
                        between themselves and the world by leading students to read classics and 
                        class discussions. We guide students to read the classic texts of the East 
                        and the West in depth, analyze and deconstruct these texts in the form of a 
                        discussion class, and give students an opportunity to present, communicate 
                        and freely debate. Through the study and communication during the study 
                        camp, students can not only enrich theoretical knowledge, but also have a 
                        clearer understanding of themselves, re-examine their values ​​and outlook on 
                        life, and make dialectical thinking a habit.

                        In the past few years, we have carried out summer liberal arts education 
                        camps in middle schools in Pujiang County, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, 
                        Zhongfang County, Hunan Province, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province and other 
                        places, and have achieved great results. This year's epidemic has brought 
                        many unprecedented challenges to the Gezhi Project. However, with the 
                        support of all parties, we still brought the summer study camp to the four 
                        cities of Changsha in Hunan, Guiyang and Kaili in Guizhou, and Yantai in 
                        Shandong. The scale reached the largest since its establishment and received 
                        positive responses from the participants.

                            We thought that we had become aboriginals in the Internet age. We 
                            thought that videos, live broadcasts, push notifications with pictures 
                            and texts, and a massive database that could be viewed at any time were 
                            enough to satisfy our thirst for knowledge and learning until the arrival 
                            of the new crown epidemic in 2020.

                                the network cable, the talks of the Jixia Academy must use the 
                                Tencent meeting. We adjusted the screen brightness and headset sound 
                                to the maximum, but we still couldn't really open the window in 
                                front of us.

                                learned is forgotten, the rest is education." During the ten days 
                                in Camp Carey, I think I was really educated. I can't remember the 
                                details of the course, or every word in the courseware. I can't 
                                remember what Athena said in the story, but I remember the necessity 
                                of the court system for society; I can't remember Antigone's defense, 
                                but I remember how to choose in social changes.
