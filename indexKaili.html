                            During the epidemic, I learned about the Gezhi plan only after seeing the public tweets shared by my family. As soon as the college entrance examination was over, I signed up and came to Kaili full of hope. Before going to Carey, the family still had questions: Is it really worth taking the risk of the new crown to participate? But in order to meet those ideal-minded, sincere, lovely, and knowledgeable group of them, I chose to leave without hesitation!

                            During these two weeks, each student will teach a course of his own design to a small class mainly composed of high school students. The course has a total of ten class hours and thirty hours. The curriculum is mainly based on group discussions. Liberal Arts Education cannot be a one-word knowledge output, but must promote the common thinking and growth of students and readers. The courses of Camp Kaili include mathematics, brain science, public history, western political philosophy, film, etc., spanning various disciplines. Before coming to Kaili, we went through a round of training, first modifying the syllabus, and then trial lectures. After such "devil training", my syllabus has long been changed beyond recognition, but I am more confident about the courses I will teach next.

                            It is a very happy thing to be a battalion commander in Gezhikaili Camp. Every reader has a unique insight and broad knowledge of their respective disciplines. Most importantly, each of them is very kind and has ideals and ambitions for liberal arts education. Every student is also very sincere and eager to learn. The way they listened carefully and discussed actively is the greatest affirmation of me as the battalion leader. During my two weeks in Carey, I personally felt the power of liberal arts education-that is the charm of creating an independent individual invisibly. In just two weeks, the process of studying with Kaili's classmates and cultivating independent thinking skills together allowed me to truly experience the joy of bringing my strength to others.

                            Thank you very much for Gezhi Project. Although we have only been together for half a month, we feel that we are friends who have reunited after a long time. Every reader is excellent, and every reader's class is wonderful. They are very attentive, enthusiastic and responsible to tell us what they have seen and heard, which opened our eyes. It turns out that I can also go to class with such a good person at close range. I am really lucky and happy! The students of Gezhi Project are also great!

                            When Yuyan found me and wanted me to write a review of Kailiying's thoughts, I didn't know where to write. The 14 days in Kaili left me too many small moments that still shine in retrospect. I don't know how to present them all in a short review. I don't know what to show for those readers who are concerned about the Gezhi Project.

                        <p>
                            I had no choice but to write something out of my mind.

                        <p>
                            The small fragments of memory are jumping and shaking, and I seem to have experienced those two unforgettable 7 days again. I probably figured it out too. What I want to show to everyone is the exclusive memory of Kaili, the cuteness and vitality of Kaili's high school students, the friendship and gains of reading people, it is an academic carnival, and it is also full of countless possibilities. experiment of.
